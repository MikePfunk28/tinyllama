["Instruction: Given a string and a set of delimiters, write a function in JavaScript to split the string. The function should split the string at the delimiters if they are followed by a space, a punctuation mark, or a capital letter. The delimiters should not be included in the resulting array. Additionally, the function should remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each split substring and convert all letters to lowercase. Example: Input: string = \"Hello, World! How are you doing today?\" delimiters = [\",\", \"!\"] Output: [\"hello\", \"world\", \"how are you doing today\"] Explanation: The string is split at the commas and exclamation marks, but not at the space before \"how\" or the space after \"today\". The resulting substrings are converted to lowercase and any leading or trailing whitespace is removed. Erroneous code example: ``` function splitString(string, delimiters) { const result = []; let substring = ''; for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) { if (delimiters.includes(string[i]) && (string[i+1] === ' ' || string[i+1] === '.' || string[i+1] === '!' || string[i+1] === '?' || string[i+1] === ',' || string[i+1] === ';' || string[i+1] === ':' || string[i+1] === ' ')) { result.push(substring.trim().toLowerCase()); substring = ''; } else { substring += string[i]; } } if (substring !== '') { result.push(substring.trim().toLowerCase()); } return result; } ``` Note: The above code is erroneous because it includes unnecessary conditions in the if statement for checking if a delimiter is followed by a space, a punctuation mark, or a capital letter.\nResponse: Corrected code: ```javascript function splitString(string, delimiters) { const result = []; let substring = ''; for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) { if (delimiters.includes(string[i]) && /[A-Z\\s\\.,;:!?]/.test(string[i+1])) { result.push(substring.trim().toLowerCase()); substring = ''; } else { substring += string[i]; } } if (substring !== '') { result.push(substring.trim().toLowerCase()); } return result; } ``` Explanation: The corrected code uses a regular expression (`/[A-Z\\s\\.,;:!?]/`) to check if a delimiter is followed by a space, a punctuation mark, or a capital letter. The regular expression pattern includes uppercase letters (`A-Z`), whitespace characters (`\\s`), and common punctuation marks (`\\.,;:!?`). This simplifies the if condition and ensures that the delimiters are split correctly.", "Instruction: Write a C++ code to find the longest common substring in two strings, but the substring must be at least 5 characters long, contain at least one digit, be palindromic, and the characters in the substring must be in lexicographically increasing order.\nResponse: Here's a C++ code that finds the longest common substring between two strings with the given conditions: ```cpp #include #include bool isPalindromic(const std::string& str) { int start = 0; int end = str.length() - 1; while (start maxLength && isValidSubstring(str1.substr(i - dp[i][j], dp[i][j]))) { maxLength = dp[i][j]; maxStart = i - dp[i][j]; } } else dp[i][j] = 0; } } return str1.substr(maxStart, maxLength); } int main() { std::string str1, str2; std::cout > str1; std::cout > str2; std::string longestCommonSubstring = findLongestCommonSubstring(str1, str2); if (longestCommonSubstring.empty()) std::cout << \"No common substring found.\"; else std::cout << \"Longest common substring: \" << longestCommonSubstring; return 0; } ``` Note: The code assumes that the input strings do not contain any whitespace characters.", "Instruction: #ifndef DATA\\_HPP #define DATA\\_HPP #include #include #include #define HIGH 100 #define LOW 0 class Data : public QObject { Q\\_OBJECT Q\\_PROPERTY(QPointF GetValue READ GetValue NOTIFY sgnl\\_ValueChanged) public: Data(QObject\\* parent = Q\\_NULLPTR); QPointF GetValue() const { return m\\_Value; } private: QTimer\\* m\\_Timer; QPointF m\\_Value; signals: void sgnl\\_ValueChanged(); private slots: void slt\\_Timeout(); };", "Instruction: Write a Python program to loop through all the items in a given list and find the sum of all even numbers in the list. The list may contain negative numbers and the sum can be negative as well. Additionally, implement the solution using a recursive function instead of a loop. Your program should also handle nested lists and find the sum of all even numbers in the nested lists.\nResponse: Here's a Python program that uses both a loop and a recursive function to find the sum of all even numbers in a given list, including nested lists: ```python def sum_even_numbers_iterative(lst): total = 0 stack = [lst] while stack: current = stack.pop() if isinstance(current, list): stack.extend(current) elif isinstance(current, int) and current % 2 == 0: total += current return total def sum_even_numbers_recursive(lst): total = 0 for item in lst: if isinstance(item, list): total += sum_even_numbers_recursive(item) elif isinstance(item, int) and item % 2 == 0: total += item return total # Example usage lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6, [7, 8], 9], 10] print(sum_even_numbers_iterative(lst)) # Output: 30 print(sum_even_numbers_recursive(lst)) # Output: 30 ``` In this program, `sum_even_numbers_iterative()` function uses a stack to iterate through the list and its nested lists. It checks if each item is a list or an even number, and adds the even numbers to the `total` variable. `sum_even_numbers_recursive()` function uses recursion to handle nested lists. It iterates over each item in the list and checks if it's a list or an even number. If it's a list, the function calls itself with that item as the argument. If it's an even number, it adds it to the `total` variable. Finally, it returns the `total` sum. Both functions produce the same output of `30` for the given example list.", "Instruction: Write a MongoDB query that returns all the records that have a \"name\" field set to \"John\" and have an age greater than 30, and also have a \"salary\" field set to a specific value.

The input string may contain any ASCII characters. Write a function named \"removeDuplicates\" that takes a string \"s\" as input and returns a string. The function should iterate through each character in the string and keep track of the characters that have already been encountered. For each character, it should check if it has already been encountered. If it has not been encountered, it should append the character to the result string. If it has been encountered, it should move on to the next character. After iterating through all the characters, the function should return the result string. If there are multiple occurrences of a character in the input string, only the first occurrence should be kept in the result string. Example: Input: \"apple\" Output: \"ale\" Additional Test Cases: Input: \"banana\" Output: \"ban\" Input: \"racecar\" Output: \"rce\" Input: \"programming\" Output: \"progmni\" Note: - The input string can have a maximum length of 10^6 characters. - The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. - The function should not use any additional data structures. **Updated Note:** - The function should use a single integer variable as an additional data structure to keep track of the characters encountered.\nResponse: Here is one possible implementation of the \"removeDuplicates\" function in Python: ```python def removeDuplicates(s): result = '' encountered = 0 for char in s: ascii_value = ord(char) if not (encountered & (1 << ascii_value)): result += char encountered |= 1 << ascii_value return result ``` This implementation uses a bitwise operator to keep track of the characters encountered. The integer variable \"encountered\" is initially set to 0. Each bit in \"encountered\" represents an ASCII character, with the nth bit representing the character with ASCII value n. When a character is encountered, the corresponding bit in \"encountered\" is set to 1 using the bitwise OR operator \"|=\". The bitwise AND operator \"&\" is used to check if a character has already been encountered by checking if the corresponding bit in \"encountered\" is set to 1. By using bitwise operations, this implementation avoids using additional data structures like sets or dictionaries to keep track of encountered characters. This allows for a space-efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.", "Instruction: Create a function to check whether a number entered is a strong prime number or not. A strong prime number is a prime number that satisfies the following conditions: 1. It is greater than 1. 2. It is not a perfect square. 3. It is not a multiple of any of the first 100 prime numbers. Note: You are not allowed to use any mathematical libraries or built-in functions to check for perfect squares or multiples of prime numbers. The time complexity of the solution should be less than O(sqrt(n)) where n is the given number.\nResponse: Here is a possible implementation in Python: ```python def is_prime(n): if n <= 1: return False if n == 2: return True if n % 2 == 0: return False i = 3 while i * i <= n: if n % i == 0: return False i += 2 return True def is_strong_prime(n): if n <= 1 or is_perfect_square(n): return False primes = [] i = 2 while len(primes) < 100: if is_prime(i): primes.append(i) i += 1 for prime in primes: if n % prime == 0: return False return True def is_perfect_square(n): if n < 0: return False sqrt_n = int(n ** 0.5) return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n # Test the function num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \")) if is_strong_prime(num): print(num, \"is a strong prime number.\") else: print(num, \"is not a strong prime number.\") ``` Explanation: 1. The function `is_prime(n)` checks whether a number `n` is prime or not. It uses the trial division algorithm to check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of `n`. 2. The function `is_perfect_square(n)` checks whether a number `n` is a perfect square or not. It calculates the square root of `n` and checks whether the square of the square root is equal to `n`. 3. The function `is_strong_prime(n)` checks whether a number `n` is a strong prime or not. It first checks whether `n` is less than or equal to 1 or a perfect square. If any of these conditions are true, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it generates the first 100 prime numbers and checks whether `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is divisible by any prime, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.", "Instruction: Design a function to remove duplicates from an unsorted array of integers in-place. The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The function should also remove all occurrences of duplicates, not just one occurrence. In addition, the function should handle negative numbers and zero in the array. The function should also remove all occurrences of duplicates while maintaining the relative order of the remaining elements. Your function should return the sorted array after removing duplicates.\nResponse: Here's a possible implementation in Python: ```python def remove_duplicates(arr): if len(arr) < 2: return arr # Use a dictionary to keep track of seen values seen = {} result = [] for num in arr: if num not in seen: seen[num] = True result.append(num) return result ``` This implementation uses a dictionary to keep track of the unique values encountered in the array. It iterates over each element in the array and checks if it has been seen before. If not, it adds the element to the result array and updates the dictionary with the seen value. By using a dictionary, the implementation ensures that only unique values are added to the result array. The order of the unique values in the original array is preserved since the implementation iterates over the array in the order of the elements. The time complexity of this implementation is O(n) because it iterates over each element in the array once, and the dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) have an average time complexity of O(1).", "Instruction: Write a JavaScript code to get the current browser URL and display it on the webpage, but without using the built-in location object.

We then define a regular expression `emailRegex` to match the given conditions of a valid email address. The regular expression is broken down as follows: - `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+` - Matches one or more alphanumeric characters at the beginning (username part). - `([._-]?[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*` - Matches zero or more occurrences of a period (.), underscore (_), or hyphen (-) followed by one or more alphanumeric characters in the username part. - `@` - Matches the \"@\" symbol. - `[a-zA-Z0-9]+` - Matches one or more alphanumeric characters in the domain name part. - `(-?[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*` - Matches zero or more occurrences of a hyphen (-) followed by one or more alphanumeric characters in the domain name part. - `(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})+` - Matches one or more occurrences of a period (.) followed by at least two alphabetic characters in the TLD part.

The maximum subarray sum in a circular array To find the maximum subarray sum in a non-circular array, we can use Kadane's algorithm.

For example, \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be considered as the same word. You should also handle punctuation marks correctly, treating them as separate characters. For example, if the input string is \"Hello, world!\", the function should consider \"world\" as a valid word with more than 7 characters, despite the presence of the comma. Finally, the function should handle words with leading or trailing spaces correctly, ignoring them and considering only the characters within the word.

Then, reverse the order of the characters in the string without using any built-in string reversal methods or functions. Input: Hello World Output: DLROW OLLEH\nResponse: Here is a possible solution in Python: ```python def reverse_string(string): # Convert the string to uppercase string = string.upper() # Convert the string to a list of characters char_list = list(string) # Reverse the order of the characters in the list start = 0 end = len(char_list) - 1 while start < end: char_list[start], char_list[end] = char_list[end], char_list[start] start += 1 end -= 1 # Convert the list of characters back to a string reversed_string = ''.join(char_list) return reversed_string # Test the function input_string = input(\"Enter a string: \") reversed_string = reverse_string(input_string) print(\"Reversed string:\", reversed_string) ``` Example usage: ``` Enter a string: Hello World Reversed string: DLROW OLLEH ```"]

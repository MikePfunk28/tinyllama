A strong prime number is a prime number that satisfies the following conditions: 1. It is greater than 1. 2. It is not a perfect square. 3. It is not a multiple of any of the first 100 prime numbers. Note: You are not allowed to use any mathematical libraries or built-in functions to check for perfect squares or multiples of prime numbers.

The function `is_prime(n)` checks whether a number `n` is prime or not. It uses the trial division algorithm to check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of `n`. 2. The function `is_perfect_square(n)` checks whether a number `n` is a perfect square or not. It calculates the square root of `n` and checks whether the square of the square root is equal to `n`. 3. The function `is_strong_prime(n)` checks whether a number `n` is a strong prime or not. It first checks whether `n` is less than or equal to 1 or a perfect square. If any of these conditions are true, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it generates the first 100 prime numbers and checks whether `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is divisible by any prime, it returns `False`.

The function should have a time complexity of O(log n) and use dynamic programming. Additionally, the function should only use a constant amount of space, without using any arrays or additional data structures.\nResponse: To generate the nth Fibonacci number with a time complexity of O(log n) and using dynamic programming with a constant amount of space, we can utilize the concept of matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented as a matrix equation: ``` | F(n+1) F(n) | = | 1 1 | ^ n | F(n) F(n-1)| | 1 0 | ``` By raising the matrix to the power of n, we can obtain the nth Fibonacci number. Here is the Python code that implements this approach: ```python def multiply_matrices(A, B): a, b, c = A[0][0], A[0][1], A[1][0] d, e, f = B[0][0], B[0][1], B[1][0] return [ [a*d + b*e, a*e + b*f], [c*d + e*d, c*e + e*f] ] def power_matrix(A, n): if n == 0: return [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix result = power_matrix(A, n // 2) result = multiply_matrices(result, result) if n % 2 == 1: result = multiply_matrices(result, A) return result def fibonacci(n): if n == 0: return 0 matrix = [[1, 1], [1, 0]] result = power_matrix(matrix, n - 1) return result[0][0] ``` In this implementation, the `multiply_matrices` function multiplies two 2x2 matrices, and the `power_matrix` function raises a matrix to the power of n using matrix exponentiation. The `fibonacci` function returns the nth Fibonacci number by calling `power_matrix` with the base matrix [[1, 1], [1, 0]] raised to the power of n - 1. Since the matrix multiplication and exponentiation operations have time complexities of O(1), and the recursive function `power_matrix` divides the problem size in half with each recursive call, the overall time complexity of this approach is O(log n). Additionally, this implementation uses a constant amount of space as it only requires a few variables to store intermediate matrix products and results.", "Instruction: Given the following object, write a function in JavaScript to count the occurrences of each character in the object's values.

We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of prime numbers in the array. 2. We iterate through each element `num` in the array. 3. If `num` is less than 2, it is not a prime number, so we skip it. 4. We assume that `num` is a prime number and set the boolean variable `is_prime` to True. 5. We iterate from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive) to check for divisors. 6. If `num` is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number, so we set `is_prime` to False and break out of the loop. 7. If `is_prime` is still True after the loop, it means `num` is a prime number, so we increment the `count` variable by 1. 8. After iterating through all elements in the array, we return the final value of `count`, which represents the number of prime numbers in the array. 9. The time complexity of this function is O(n * sqrt(m)) because we iterate through each element in the array (n steps) and for each element, we check divisors up to its square root (sqrt(m) steps), where m is the maximum value in the array.\nResponse: ```python def count_prime_numbers(arr): count = 0 for num in arr: if num < 2: continue is_prime = True for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1): if num % i == 0: is_prime = False break if is_prime: count += 1 return count arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] print(count_prime_numbers(arr)) ```", "Instruction: Can you make a pricing list example that will cost someone $1200, within this list would be: audiovisual package, visual package, audio package, 4 revisions, 20-30 minute video", "Instruction: can you use how, what and why as main sections and divide above into it", "Instruction: Please sumarize this in a logline They\u2019ve canceled my flight and I must get home immediately!

The first step is to calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of the input numbers. This can be done using the XOR operator `^`. If the signs of the two numbers are different, the result will be negative, otherwise positive. 2. Next, we convert both numbers to positive by taking their absolute values. This is done to simplify the multiplication process, as bitwise operations work better with positive numbers. 3. We initialize the result variable to 0. 4. The main logic of the multiplication is implemented using a while loop that continues until b becomes 0. 5. In each iteration of the loop, we check if the least significant bit of b is set (i.e., b & 1 is non-zero). If it is, we add the value of a to the result. This is equivalent to adding a to the result the number of times specified by the value of the corresponding bit in b. 6. After that, we shift a to the left by 1 bit (i.e., a >= 1) to process the next bit in b. 8. Once the loop ends, we return the result multiplied by the sign to get the correct sign for the result.

It adds the discounted price to the running total and checks if the discounted price is greater than the threshold. If it is, it increments the count of discounted items above the threshold. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the total discounted price and the count of discounted items above the threshold.", "Instruction: Write me a 30-second elevator pitch that I can use to an investor", "Instruction: Write me a 4 panel comic with this setup", "Instruction: Hello, could you tell me how I can automate the deploy of a gitlab hosted repository of a project to a bare metal machine (which has a docker-compose.yml for quick start), that based on config name, it would fetch a config.json and other custom assets and replace them on that deployed project?

The nested list can contain integers and lists, and can have up to four levels of nesting. The final sum should only include the integers within the nested lists, and not the lists themselves. Additionally, your code should be able to handle cases where the nested lists are not provided in a consistent manner. For example, the input could contain a mixture of integers and lists at each level of nesting, or the depth of nesting could vary across different elements of the input. Your code should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the input list.\nResponse: Here is the code to flatten a nested list of integers and return the sum of all the elements: ```python def flatten_and_sum(lst): total_sum = 0 def helper(lst): nonlocal total_sum for item in lst: if isinstance(item, int): total_sum += item elif isinstance(item, list): helper(item) helper(lst) return total_sum ``` To test the code: ```python # Example 1 nested_list = [1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6] print(flatten_and_sum(nested_list)) # Output: 21 # Example 2 nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]], 6, [7, [8, [9]]]] print(flatten_and_sum(nested_list)) # Output: 45 # Example 3 (Inconsistent nesting) nested_list = [1, [2, [3, [4]]], [5, [6]], [7, [8, [9, 10, 11]]]] print(flatten_and_sum(nested_list)) # Output: 66 ``` The code uses a helper function `helper` to recursively iterate over the nested list. It checks each element and if it is an integer, adds it to the `total_sum`. If it is a list, the function calls itself recursively with the sublist as an argument. This way, it handles multiple levels of nesting. The `nonlocal` keyword is used to access the `total_sum` variable from the outer scope. The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the input list. This is because we need to iterate over each element in the list exactly once.", "Instruction: Find the frequency of each letter in the given phrase \"May the force be with you!\" and return the letter(s) with the highest frequency.
